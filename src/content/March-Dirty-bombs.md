#### March resulted in a total of 5 Dirty Bombs being dropped Why tho?  

### The Hcom3 Bomb

Hcom3 Actually [quit an Year ago](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16169821&b=0&a=0), He only came back for Elimination 2020 where he [lead Karma Farmers to Top 4](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16187049&b=0&a=0&start=0&to=20798741) then went dark again till.... he finally decided to login 2 weeks ago and call it quits for once and all. He decided to run a [giveaway](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=13&t=16215207) and kept doing RR Matches till he finally won enough to buy a Dirty Bomb. 

I Managed to Interview Hcom tad bit before he dropped his bomb if you're Interested to read the Raw Interview [you can do so here](https://oran.pw/hcom.txt) (would recommend opening this on PC)

#### The Drop 

After pulling a huge Troll on the forums where he claimed he dropped the bomb on NATURAL SELECTION II the faction he was in before he quit, On Detonation the truth was out, He dropped the bomb on Subversive Alliance 

>Obviously this was a troll, I wanted to make this thread as PJ gave me its great idea. The actual Bomb was on SA as you can now tell.It was kinda hard picking between IBB and this, but I think this was funnier.
