Cloudjumper shares some helpful advice  
>It is okay to give your stuff to your friend, as long as you are two different people.  
Also remember that it is illegal to middleman your stuff to your new account. So if you decide to restart later on, your friend shouldn't be sending the stuff back to you on your new account. In such cases, your new account will be stripped of the gains and the friend fedded for middle-manning.
