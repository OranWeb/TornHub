Skipper wants to know which Elimination team [is winning this year](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=2&t=16182195&b=0&a=0)   

MightyDuck's Rant Thread about the local news article can be read [here](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=2&t=16182007&b=0&a=0) the best part of it is probably sugarvalves reply.  
>I'm happy to publish both sides of the story, and I always want to, but a lesson I learned very early on is that it's much easier to put out one side if you want the other side to be told. Some people don't reply to my inquiries because they're too busy or disinterested, but they sure become talkative once the other party has had their say in full view of everyone. This is the most efficient way of getting news out. I always get both sides, eventually.

>In your case, despite your betrayal of both mine and Chedburn's trust, I'd have been happy to publish your version of events if you'd sent it over in response to the article. But given that this thread is now four pages long and we still haven't seen any comment from you on the accusations made by Chohivzla, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, and firewalks like a duck, it may indeed be a duck. -sugarvalves
