Twills woke up from his deep sleep and created a discussion Thread [Here](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16181956&b=0&a=0) about having the ability to Play Poker while flying. OP also calls us "torners" which makes me cringe hard then Apeks & 878Battlecat shows up and claims [Ched Doesn't give a shit](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16181956&b=0&a=0&to=20708523) you can find bogie's reply below  

> I think to suggest that Ched doesn't give a shit about a game he's been making for the last 16 years is fairly absurd, I can't speak for his decision on it specifically but to me being able to play the casino whilst flying doesn't make sense? As... you're not in the casino. - BrotherBogie
