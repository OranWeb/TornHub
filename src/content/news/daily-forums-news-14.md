Elimination is "Almost" coming to an end, in the last 3 days we saw 3 teams go out,
1. Vikings Proudly Wins the 8th Position and are on [their way to Valhalla](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16186437&b=0&a=0)
2. Total Bankers Win the 7th Position, Bankers were perceived as a strong powerful fully stacked team, Doesn't really matter who wins the competition but Bankers have definitely [left their Mark in this competition.](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=2&t=16186561&b=0&a=0)
3. Seal Team Six Wins the 6th Position, right, it was in their name. [Mightygoober gives his rundown](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16186790&b=0&a=0)

Andyman's Team TerrorBytes which also houses infamous idiot DUDE DUDE has a [Rant thread on the Murder Hornets](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=2&t=16186840&b=0&a=0)  

IndyCision was looking around for some [Napkin ideas](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16186798&b=0&a=0) since Dude Dude kept his end of the bargain and now its time for the "Graphs go brrr" guy to eat napkins on camera. he does mention "weaponzing dude dude" but I personally think its just his excuse to not fulfill his promise #MakeAndyEatNapkin   

In the other news thats not actually about Elimination, Elite Gets [Vault Scammed](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16186404&b=0&a=0) (Again)

Things come to a stop abruptly then Xanet Resigns from Leadership and Gives ELITE Leadership and informal ownership to a restart friend of his. The faction does seem to be in good hands so far, although the whole ordeal is pretty strange. well least the new guy has gotten the graphics sorted tho.

Rum4nyby needs some help [with his training](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=3&t=16186839&b=0&a=0)  

Awsmm_ was wondering what happens with [non-consumeable Items](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=3&t=16186770&b=0&a=0)  

chuckyvoorhes won the RNG Lotto and also 1528 ranking at [bounties received.](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=16&t=16186848&b=0&a=0)  

Brakier gets the Globbertrotter (travel for 365 days) [Honorbar at 999 Days](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=16&t=16186821&b=0&a=0&start=0).   

IndyCision got the 'Nice' Honorbar with a total bs of 13,773. Now that is Nice.  

OsRavan got in 590 hits in [Elimination at day 200](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=16&t=16186351&b=0&a=0). Now that is Impressive.  
>I wanted to make this thread, cause i'm kind of proud of it! Despite being only 200 or so days old when elimination started, I managed 590 hits! Which was good enough for second place on my team (toothpaste) behind Jokur.  
No idea what the record is for someone under a year old (I probably dont have it in terms of total hits cause we got bumped early. But maybe for place finishing on a team? Dont know if any newer folks have finished second.)  
Either way, the experience was fun at times. Frustrating as hell at times. A ton of time and effort. But I learned a lot. And like i said im pleased with how i did.  

Ahab wrote a Mask/Helmet replace script and it shouts "i love you, you love me, we're best friends like friends should be" [from Miles away](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16186654&b=0&a=0)  
I've had a good look at the script its pretty simple and safe to use would recommend using 10/10
