warlord1995 has come out with his [bold decision to make multis](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16182356&b=0&a=0)    
>My multi was worth 644m when I got banned.
At first I thought it was a permanent ban but I was banned for 7 days and the ban was lifted after 7 days.
Amazingly I had transferred nearly 50m in forms of cash, xanax and morphine from my multis and that amount was deducted from my account.
I started off with negative money on hand and started selling what I had in my inventory (from Christmas Town) and once I got some money from it, rented a PI and started travelling for xanax, plushies and flowers. Also started selling revives like a madman.
Now my networth is 550m+ and I'm in the reviving HoF
