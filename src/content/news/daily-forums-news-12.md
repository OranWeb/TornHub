Supreme Peasant Hit- Expalins why he is no longer a Peasant   
>SO today at 11am bst 13/09/20 i left the peasants discord. the peasants was a amazing place where i made lifetime friends such as the_boss, Lat, Silver_rose etc.
i left due to me not giving a shit about the competition anymore and i frankly got bored of leeching, this was due to me being busy irl for most of the competion and seeing some future inactivity.
i was top 20 in hits when i was actually hitting, with 90 then i stopped giving a shit and started training and leeching.
The send of was mad emotional and i loved my place their to all the other teams the peasants are gonna win dont underestimate us !!!.
