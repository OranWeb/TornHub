Yesterday was patch Tuesday, there was a slight 10 minutes downtime but site quickly returned back to normal with some new updates, firstly a new daily login / activity streak probably to keep you coming back, Minigun was changed from Heavy Artillery to Machine gun the properties value in networth was changed to sellback value and a new Infrastructure Engineer was added to the Developers Team (not to be confused with Chris Wolf the economy guy.)

HealingBot was wondering why no one was [talking about Elimination](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16182947&b=0&a=0)  
>Just 5 more days to, why one is talking about Elimination '20, am not that active and just came back to see the buzz. Last year I join a team but I lost the chance to even see how it goes.
