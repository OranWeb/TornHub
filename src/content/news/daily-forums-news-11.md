Celebrity Idiot Dude Dude, who not even pandemic would accept has decided to [publicly Apologize](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=2&t=16184357&b=0&a=0) for his behavior.  
>First of all I would like to apologise for my behavior last few days.
For not being a part of the team
For accusing my teammates of being bullies. (Immediately got it graved once I realized my mistake)
For talking shit to all the members with no regard for human life.
I know I will not be forgiven or let back in team chats. However, I promise to still do my part and make hits on whatever team the leadership needs me to. I will step out of your way, and let you guys do your thing.
Because I want to win, just like you guys want to win.
Together we are stronger. Let's go.

Is he Terrified by his team? we may find out soon.
