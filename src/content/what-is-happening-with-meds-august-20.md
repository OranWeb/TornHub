excerpt: Why has the Medical Items Market Suddenly Crashed?
---

###### Hello and welcome to our first article of the segment "[What is Happening](../tags/what-is-happening)" in this one we'll be covering about medical items that recently had a good crash in their values.  

#### One would claim Medical Items are the most used items out of any category but with the New Territory changes does This still stand true?  

At the Time of Writing on 27/8/20 Small First aid kits have fallen below the Price of Empty Blood Bags with almost $500 difference in their price. First Aid Kits sit at a mere 23,000 Which was Considered as the Normal Price for Small First Aid Kits and Morphine's sit around 33K

The Question that I mostly get is "What is Happening with Medical Items" that's from where the segment name is stolen in case your wondering... :P. To Find out I Decided to sit down with few Trader's in [TornHub Discord](https://discord.gg/yvNCTXB), to have them share their thoughts on the Topic.  

Scofield Jumps in and wonders _"okay seriously.. what is happened meds?? "_ Unique adds to that, _"Seriously, even when i add just 1000 meds, it will go down, (I) have stopped thinking about it altogether._ Which Implies Trader's have already felt the effects of the Price Drop and the Market Saturation from all Trader's getting rid of their stocks and Faction Leaders getting rid of their "Fake Walls" Supplies.  

ddtyterminator a Smol prawn but not a likkle fish, has some thoughts to share, he think its a good change for small meds users
 _"apparently meds is now lower on market than on pharmacy? i dont have access to pharmacy. On one hand, it is good cuz ppl like me who cant buy from pharmacy can just buy from market. "_  
ddtyterminator However has a Big Brain solution for it, _" only way for it to recover i feel isnt to increase demand. it is to tell everyone to sell at a higher price"_  

Scofield Believes there's no way for Meds to recover, "sfaks are f(tornfriendlycontent)ked coz of 5e walls... morhpines are the worst... blood bags dropping coz too much supply..."

##### The 5e Walls?
Yes the 5E Walls, it is great timing that scofield mentions that, the small kits which is used by factions that used to fake wall for their neighbors were affected by the recent addition of 5e [per wall join](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=1&t=16174354&b=0&a=0) now those factions either don't fake wall at all or just do real walls. Hence they do not have to buy them weekly/monthly for fake walls but rather to just replenish from normal faction use.
