excerpt: Hemi and Burger tells me all about their School for kittens
---
This happened 5 months ago but an interesting experiment regardless. it's not every day that you find people willing to do amazing things in the game, but that is exactly what [Hemi](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2165616) and Burger (aka [Scarlett-X](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2095421#/) ) seemed to have done    

_"Burger-Hemeow School for Kittens Who Want to Get Stronk But Don't Have the Proper Resources and Require Assistance."_

**To figure out what exactly they did I decided to sit down with Hemi and Burger, they gave me a detailed rundown**   

>_"We made a [thread on the forums](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=13&t=16149166&b=0&a=0) asking (people) to "apply" for the kitten training program for a month._  
_They applied by filling out a quiz we made, with a variety of game questions. We picked the ones who looked active, needed the most help, and put thought into their reply_  
_We got 4. One of them turned out to be a multi and the other took all the free shit we gave and ran  
one quit midway because her parents didn't like her to be on the internet."_   

Hemi and Burger spent a month teaching their 'kittens' to play TORN, they gave them daily as well as weekly lessons on different TORN Topics alongside some Homework. kittens also had to do things and present, so Hemi and burger could verify if they learned something.   

Initially, there were 18 out of which only 4 made it into the round. They were looking for player's that were highly active, eager to learn with a genuine interest in the game, respectful towards other, stick around for 30 days and more importantly that had Good sense of Humor  

Most of the questions Hemi and Burger asked were trick questions

>_The 2 that lasted the month program were really good and eager to learn, One of them is still playing actively and making dough The others donator pack expired and she refuses to fly to make money so she doesn't play This is making me want to do round 2  >.<   We also had a detention room  When we found out someone was a multi we put her in the detention room and made her confess_

Burger explains the purpose of the experiment  
>it's like you get bored doing the same shit again and again. the quest for gym stats is never-ending. at the same time, you see other people who are clueless and you remember your noob days. so we decided we will guide promising people so they don't commit mistakes which we did

they also shared their Disappointments during the experiment
>the main disappointment was the one who turned out to be a restart of someone and was using their wealth of the previous account and Hoarding what we gave  
we told them that we reported them because they were having a 500k respect faction without a co-leader  
She played dumb for a week or two, pretending to be a noob  
But she was a leader of a faction, had a high net worth, and never flew
And would say stuff like, "so flying is good right? Ok, got it"

However, even after some bad experiences with the experiment, the school might just return in the future  
>  We thought about doing it again and doing a better job vetting folks, but so far hadn't done round 2. I fear that people pretend they need help just to get free shit and that defeats the purpose of what we are doing
We both were bored and had money burning in our pockets. We like to help noobs casually but wanted to make an official thing and set them up for success long term  
We'll have to do the vetting round differently next time. Like older age noobs should be considered, whereas before we were only looking at young accounts. But u run the risk of helping a multi or someone who won't stick around very long
