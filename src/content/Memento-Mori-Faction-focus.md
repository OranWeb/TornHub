#### Welcome back to another faction focus article! This one we'll be discussing about Memento Mori aka MM.

###### Memento Mori used to be a Good faction back in the day, it was also called as a faction 'to keep an eye on' in the [newspaper article 5 years ago](https://www.torn.com/newspaper.php#!/articles/185), to see what exactly happen and how the faction disappeared I sat down with Tascon (leader), sparkyMarky, Donandres, and OC Manager M3G47HR0N    

The original faction id 8706 hasn't disappeared per say, its still alive in existence and kicking as unleashed, However, the Faction timeline is pretty fascinating (you can check out the fancy timeline graphics if you continue reading)  

>The faction Memento Mori was originally named "The Little House on the Prairie" and founded with my 2 good friends back then - Whiterose (may she rest in peace) and UnFairlane (A good danish friend of mine with similar interest in online games)
We wanted to have a retreatment place for us to sit and grow old, no pressure, no wars or issues - just laid back training for years to come...  
Whiterose had an illness in RL and knew her time was short, so that was her reason for getting a safe place to stay.  
I was a bit more active and social and gained many relationships along the way. I have always wanted to help new people to the game - and help them grow. The big factions controlled the game, and it was hard for anyone to get into a good faction without any help to progress.

Tascon realized at this Point that faction members liked the way he managed the faction and he Personally wanted to have more action hence he had members and leaders Create Memento Mori.

>We ran speed chains and competed against teams within the faction to get the best score. We had an amazing team with great activity, which meant that we actually had good hard-fought wars against top factions. Many thought we were a slow bad faction because we ranked low. We did that to make the most respect while climbing the ranks (respect gain was different back then). We ended up beating tougher forces on the paper due to the stamina of our team, which of course boosted the morale of the members big time

_(Faction id 8706 Timeline)_

Memento Also had a Merger a long time ago with Forged Through War and formed "Forged Memento" I was in MM when the merger happened. before moving to FTW _having no idea what happen_ either way this failed merger set precedent that Not all mergers are successful   

>The merge with FTW was made by me as the last chance to have the faction live longer
I have personally been running a faction for many years, I have had good co-leaders to help me with the job. But the leader always has work to do. I realized at some point that the time I spend in the game was affecting my Real Life and simply booked too much of my time. So I wanted to try and have a larger leader squad to split the work  

However, for Tascon Things don't go very Well,

>I ended up running FTW and MM mostly alone for a short period. Until I had to back out and reversed the merger. Better run 1 faction good than 2 factions average.  
So I was back to square 1 and really wanted to unload the workload.  
 Didn't want to abandon all the good members and what we had built. But at the time we had no one step up and taking the torch to move on.   
 So when I got a good offer on the faction I took it and send much of it back to the core of the faction. And now I live my torn life as a normal citizen with no hassle and can play whenever I feel like it and have the time for it

The Faction was eventually sold to Saltama/Egypt a well-known faction flipper for a sum close to 87,000,000,000

>I was offered a huge amount of 87b I think was the number
It was his/her full net worth and I was told he/she wanted a faction with good perks to just sit and train and grow old. A final spot and an achievement which was on her list which had to be done as a final thing
It was all her account had of assets.  
Meaning mostly stocks
whose value dropped sometime after the trade but I was lucky to keep them for a bit and sold at an ok price, so the deal was ok for me. I was dealing stocks anyway and would have invested the cash in stocks if I was offered that in the trade. So I'm not complaining.  

While working on the article VitaGreta mentioned something about the company tascon is holding being a reminiscence of the Faction,

>I founded the company with MM funding, that being said - it was a way for members to get a huge interest on their torn savings, I gave all members an option to buy-in in my investment plan
Each share was sold for 1b, with an interest payout 6% each month.

Tascon used the funds to buy and run the Oil Rig, he also invested some cash into items and stocks.   

>Members were offered good solid pay, no matter their work stats. If they took a spot in the rig.   
You could always sell your share and get your 1b back at any time
So it worked as an investment fund.  
 you can say
Boosting members network and helping them progress in the game I covered the expenses and even when I had a loss, members always got their returns

(A MM member got this Tatoo on their arm)

Donandres08 Another MM Members jumps in and shares his personal experience being in the faction and How he and his 5 friends ended up in MM  

>We are All Danes and had a small faction called the Royal Danish Army. We were all new players, so we didn’t really have anything.  
 Tascon reached out to me and the other leader Ceberix and we talked back and forth. Until one point where we decided to join MM and that was the best-torn move I made.  
MM was by any means not a faction who had many trolls or a super active chat. But, as Tascon also mentioned, we did this thing where we made chaining teams - one for each day, and some people signed up to be team leaders to make sure their team was full. Chaining was so much different back then and that was the way we made much of our respect.  

Donandres08 tells us a little about the wars they fought,
> we had some great wars with JFA and some other factions in similar size. What we lacked though, were their strong guests - which often decided the close wars. Tascon had a few really big hitters, but it wasn’t enough regardless we always fought hard and if you look at NS and some other factions, many old MM members are now in the upper tier in regards to stats but also chaining.  
 We really tried hard to teach people how to chain properly and not waste hits.  
  Tascon was a great leader because he always wanted to help out. But he has a strict moral code - don’t cheat or be a dick! And I think that was what made the core of MM so solid - and also why old MM members still reach out to me and say stuff like “I wish MM was still around”.

(MM's Currency)

Donandres mentions about how they had to get rid of some members

>We had to get rid of some strong members sometimes because they did not live up to what Tascon (and what the core of MM) wanted for our members to be like. I remember, that it was always so close for us to get into the upper tier, and then we had some members doing stupid stuff and getting kicked. Marshmallow was one of them

sparkyMarky who currently resides in NS, shares his pleasant experience being in MM  

>I think I joined around 2011/2012. I remember dragging a chain through the 2012 London opening ceremony. We had a few formative fights with similar strength factions. Little Stompers is the only one that still remains around today. [King_K](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=23984) carried us hard through the early days. Always rescuing us when our chains were near dying.  
[Second2none](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=1615950) was a good organizer but left later on. [M3G47HR0N](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=343124) organized our crimes for ages  

There were a lot of wars but MM had a core of active players and was confident if they could withstand the first onslaught then they could grind down most factions.  

>I think we hit our peak around 2016 when I believe were reasonably a top ten faction. There was an incident where someone got banned (possibly Insulting aggressive forum behavior or scamming) and their leaving dragged away 4 or 5 of our newer more active people.  

He also Mentions about their Beef with Just Fer A**holes  

>We scheduled an organized war with them. A little before we started to run a chain and it managed to get to exactly 4000. The faction was a bit burnt out. So we canceled the scheduled war.  
 JFA was a bit butt hurt and declared on us anyway and won with little fighting back. I believe we fought back later on but not completely sure. There was much forum trash talking. Ironically a good amount of us left for JFA. Including me, after we disbanded.    

>One of our last wars was a suicide rush at JFK. Sadly I missed it but I always had the most fun being a soldier in the fierce fights. No matter whether we won or lost.  

M3G47HR0N the Official OC Manager of MM, who till this day still has a copy of the OC rankings shares his experience being in MM,

>I started playing TORN much earlier but I was too noob to survive and make good progress back then.
Like most people with old characters, I quit for many years. Then only came back playing in early 2012.
Still very noob to the game, with very low stats for my character's age and level, I decided to give it another try.

M3G47HR0N was then approached by someone from MM, he's unable to recall who exactly,  

>So, I joined MM with my shitty stats and grinding my way as I learn about the game properly from Tascon.
So that's how I joined MM, and stayed with it for many years until it got sold and changed hands.  
Personally, I really liked being in MM because of the friendly atmosphere. Where everyone also helps and respects each other.  
On top of that, we had good leadership and Tascon was always very helpful to everyone back then, including me.  
So as the faction grew over the years, so did our members. Over time, I gained trust from leadership and Tascon offered me to be in charge of OC.  

M3G47HR0N didn't know much about OCs but he still accepted the role,  

>Originally, we had only 1 PA team back then, and the rest were your typical PRs, and some RMTs(Robbing Money Trains).  
Figuring things out by trial-and-error was quite fun and interesting for me. Especially about CE, and other factors that seem to affect OC outcomes.  
So over the years, I managed OCs and set everyone to be in the best possible OCs based on their NNBs to help them improve their NNBs.  
This was done through careful planning and discussions with Tascon, and I recorded most OC related stuff in my spreadsheets and also in faction forums.   
At our peak, we had 4 stable PA teams (which was quite a lot back then for a faction), 2 PH teams, and a bunch of RMTs(Robbing Money Trains not real money trade.) and a few PRs.  
The PA teams grew either from having new PA leaders from new members, or some old members gained enough CE from being in PH for many years.
Needless to say, I learned a lot about OCs, PAs, CE, and managing members.

At the same time, he helped the faction gain respect and money for the faction  

>I was also helped by a few others in managing OCs (like Tonia, Bovy, etc).
I also shared and taught some people about the knowledge of OCs and PAs, like CloudJumper.
Basically, I knew the NNBs for all members. I record them both in forums and in my spreadsheets.  
Because of that, I basically had the list of all members that ever been in MM while I was OC manager.
So over the years, I saw people came and went, and some names I still recognize until today that they used to be in MM. Including ORAN himself!  

##### Where are the Original MM Members now?

>Most of us are in NS now (Sparky, Don, Flander, Ceberix, CloudJumper, Rhino, etc), and some are in other factions (Tascon, Crayfish, Suneo, Tonia, Bovy, Slothex, KmKid, herself, etc).
Even though some of them are in 'enemy' factions, we still consider each other friends apparently.
I do chat with some of them from time to time.
MM really was our home back then, with its friendly atmosphere. And most of us MM cores helped build the faction together, from the ground up, as an underdog and barely known back then, and made it quite formidable over the years, and later recognized even by some HoF factions.
It was really shocking and sad to see it was sold but it was already done so it was best to just start moving on back then.
Besides, MM had a very good run and it was quite fun while it lasted.  
On top of that, it was quite liberating to be finally no longer an OC manager, as it was quite hard for me to maintain when RL became really busy with work.  
I think that's good enough from me. Thanks for this opportunity to trace and remember back the good old days.
