#### Disclaimer: I Had No Special Privileged Access to Information, what you're about to read is entirely My Thoughts and research into the Topics. This Article Cover's Patchlist #166 to #169. 

Developers Focus is incredible to stay updated about the upcoming changes/updates to the game,  for instance, "Crime Writing" which Alice has been focusing on for Eternity and _will focus on for Eternity._

That being said let's figure out what developers were focusing on for November:- 

### 1. Project Management  
Chedburn is responsible for Managing all Torn Projects. Project management is the process of leading the work of the team to achieve goals and meet success criteria at a specified time.  
From what I've heard, Project Docs are created by Chedburn and are Submitted to Developers for them to work on.  

### 2. Crimes 2.0  
~~The Future of Crimes that may one day arrive on 2089~~ Crimes 2.0 is a complete overhaul of the existing Crimes system. First Teased many many years ago and is currently being developed, It is perhaps one of the Largest Project Torn has been working on and was [55% Complete on 22/02/2016](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=1&t=15964643&b=0&a=0&start=0&to=16862702) although the post states "Initial Release" I believe Chedburn has changed his mind and it will be released in Full at once.   

> Crimes 2.0 is pretty cool, I don't want to talk about this because I think it's a long way off, but it is progressing slowly. We've just hired a creative writer to initially plan the detailed structure and formatting of the crime results. -[Source](https://www.torn.com/forums.php?p=threads&f=1&t=15973100&b=0&a=0&start=0&to=17056842)  

### 3. Full activity log  

Activity Log was released earlier this year on [26/05/20](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=1&t=16164561) but it was only an initial release,

> Once we're happy that the 'Recent History' panel is working as expected, we're planning on adding a full 'Activity Log' page that will allow you to search through all of your logs by category and date ranges. We're planning to store all logs forever, so you'll have a complete history of everything that you've ever done.  -[Source](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=1&t=16164561)

The Full Activity Log will be released in the future, it will be located on a separate page. If you're impatient and would like to export current logs here's a [Nice Scrip](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16198776&b=0&a=0) by Lugburz it allows you to filter as well export as CSV file. It does however require you to select on the activity log and hold the page-down button unless you're on a MacBook Air like me.  
  
### 4. Loadouts release
New Loadout system was released on [03/11/20](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=1&t=16194035&b=0&a=0) right after patch #166  
>We've just released a system for managing different equipment loadouts, you'll now see this at the top of the Items page. This has the following features...
 See your currently equipped armor and clothing. Click on the image to enlarge it.
 Weapons, Armor, Clothing, Mods & Ammunition you equip is saved in a Loadout.
 Rename loadouts, and swap between them depending on your requirements.
 Click or tap a weapon's ammunition to instantly toggle between special ammunitions.

### 5. Weapon & armor bonuses  
These are special Bonuses for weapon/armors like for instance Demoralize for Gold Plated AK-47's or Freeze for Snow Canon. You can find the Full List [here](https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Weapon_bonuses#Bonus_List)  

### 6. Core updates & refactoring  

These updates involve Important changes to the site's code and refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software while preserving its functionality.  

### 7.  WAI support 

Alexander usually works on implementing and Improving accessibility functions for the site. If you're interested you can read more about WAI [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative)  

### 8. Countdown timer module
I'm not exactly sure what or where the Countdown timer module is being implemented but my best guess is the developer is working on implementing better or rather more accuracy for the energy/nerve bars.  

### 9. Google Play payment integration 
Torn is currently working on integrating Google Play Payments into the Donator House, meaning you'd be able to purchase DPs directly through the Torn Android App, and again this will also result in more options since Google Play's system is Flexible in terms of what they accept.  You can find Joshua's Comment [here](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=4&t=16098532&b=0&a=0&start=0&to=19359338)

### 10. Bugs & Issues
This means the Developer is also focused on fixing Bugs apart from whatever their regular role is.  

### 11. Bot hunter anti-cheat system  
The new Bothunter system intends to capture and send users using Bots to make automated actions in the game to federal jail. here's a relevant comment from Joshua when GF was fedded. 
>This has been part of a fairly long term project, big props to Dima on the development team here for his help, of which CSP was a part of and other bot hunter projects.
This is still ongoing but users who are very clearly automating their actions to play the game, train in the gym, bypass the captcha, and are profiting in the 10s or 100s of billions have been logged and are in the process of being deleted.
This is but the start of a series of ongoing logs 10s of millions of rows long and we have just begun to scratch the surface with some fairly high profile jailings such as this one and some lower tier ones scattered in the mix as well. In some cases users have been using programs that have been offered out there for sale, in other cases people had their own dedicated servers specifically set up for the purpose of playing their accounts, and others, for them or multis to feed a singular individual.
Ultimately, if you want to break the rules to such a degree then you are only wasting your own time as at the end of the day we will catch up to you and all of that effort will be for nothing.  

### 12. Temporary accounts for mobile app registration 

Temporary Accounts would be severely limited kinds of accounts, perhaps to give PlayStore's new player's an experience of the game before they signup, basically a Torn Trial.  

### 13. CT2020

### 15. Ranked warring
